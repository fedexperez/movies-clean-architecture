# Movies App

App which aims to consume external APIs where it extracts information and based on it we create our models and use them to display widgets and those widgets are displayed in a beautiful way we will use what is the patch View scroll.

We'll use a custom card widget.
We will sketch the whole process of a search to make it look as natural as possible.
Also we use the BLoC as state management pattern, and FVM that helps with the need for consistent app builds by referencing the Flutter SDK version used on a per-project basis.
